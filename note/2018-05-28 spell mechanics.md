Trying to figure out all of the mechanics around how spells work with character
progression, stats, and equipment.

Here's the sort of high level goals:

- Magic users have an encyclopedic, "micromanage" play style. Instead of a few
  versitable, flexible options, they have a long list of specific spells to
  choose from for each situation. Magic user players like lists. Likely to be
  stamp collectors.

- General magic users get access to most spells, but not the strongest spells
  in each school. No character has access to all spells.

- Specialists get some access to spells in other schools. A specialist probably
  spends 80% of the time casting spells in their own school.

There's two ways you could make a spell stronger: lower the cost to cast it, or
directly increase its power. The former gives the player more fine-grained
control. For example, they could choose to cast a damage spell once each on two
different enemies instead of dishing out a single double-strength hit on a
single one. But increasing spell power lets them dish out damage *faster*.

It might be cool to have spells grow in power, but I think that makes it harder
to design and tune the mechanics. It also doesn't align with the encyclopedic
play style I want. So let's say that spells have a single fixed power. That
removes a degree of freedom in the design.

Given that, here's how the mechanics can work:

- A spell is discovered by finding the right spellbook. (Q: Do you need to keep
  holding the spellbook to use it?)

- Each spell has an intellect requirement to be able to use it. More powerful
  spells require more intellect. Since stats grow over time, this effectively
  unlocks them later. It also encourages players to choose intellect-heavy
  races so they get spells sooner.

- Each spell has its own focus cost to use it.

- Maximum focus is determined by intellect.

- Will determines how much focus is lost when taking damage. Low will heroes
  are easily distracted and lose a lot. Increasing will makes the hero more
  able to concentrate and wade into battle. At very high levels, taking damage
  may actually *increase* focus.

  So, typical pure mages don't need to put much into will because they try to
  stay out of the fray. "Battle mages" and other hybrid classes have greater
  will but relatively less intellect. They can go into battle without as much
  risk, but their spells aren't as powerful.

- Specialist classes lower the intellect requirement of spells in their school
  and raise the others. Some spells end up with impossible intellect
  requirements, which deliberately makes them off limits for some classes.

- There are equipment affixes that lower the focus cost of specific spells, all
  spells, or spells within school.

- Affixes that raise intellect effectively give heroes access to stronger
  spells and let them cast more since max focus goes up.
