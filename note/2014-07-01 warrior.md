Members of the warrior class are straight-forward simple people who
prefer to get by on the strength of their arms rather than the powers
of their magic or intellect. They are excellent in battle, and feel
comfortable using all manner of weapons and wearing the heaviest of
armor. Magic is rather foreign to their simple worldview, but they
would not hesitate to use an enchanted sword if it would improve their
skills in battle, although spellcasting is completely beyond them.
Warriors rely on their physical attributes, and these rarely let them
down. They are strong, fast, and hard to kill.

## Play style

Warrior players play to kill. They want to simply attack anything that
moves (with some strategy), and get better gear. For a warrior player,
the challenge is in winning battles and to a lesser extent choosing
proper equipment, and not fine-tuning spells or other complicated
character management.

Because of this, warrior class skills are mostly passive. They simply improve things the player is already doing. Likewise, the player does not have to specifically choose to improve a skill. Instead, skills are "trained" -- the warrior gets better automatically simply by performing the right kinds of actions.

## Class powers

### Passive skills

* **Vigor:** Increases max health. Trained by taking damage.

* **Fighting:** Increases damage when attacking bare-handed. Trained by attacking bare-handed.

* **Combat:** Increases damage. Trained by killing any monster.

* **Weapon mastery:** Increases damage when wielding weapon of certain type. There is a separate skill for each weapon type. Trained by using weapon of that type.

* **Slaying:** Increases damage against monsters of certain type. There is a separate skill for each category of monster. Trained by killing monsters of that type.

* **Toughness:** Gives a bonus to armor. Trained by the hero being hit and taking damage.

* **Regeneration:** Allows health regeneration even without eating. Trained by taking damage while low on health.

* **Immunity:** Reduces poison duration. At high levels, resists poison. Trained by taking poison damage. (Similar skills for resisting other elements: "iron skin", "stone skin", "fortitude", etc.)

* **Endurance:** Increases damage when low on health. Trained by killing monsters when health is low.

* **Courage:** Increases damage when attacking monster whose health is greater than hero's. Trained by same.

### Special moves

Warriors can also learn a couple of special moves. Like passive skills, these are learned by training.

To use a move, a warrior spends *rage*. This is a stat that is *regained* by being attacked. (Its works like the opposite of the focus score for mages.)

* **Fury:** Provides a temporary speed boost. (TODO: How is this trained?)
* **Berzerk:** Does an area effect damage surrounding the hero,basically a sweeping attack. Trained by attacking multiple different monsters in short succession.
* **Battle cry:** Frightens nearby monsters. Trained by frightening (through any means).
* **Bash:** Pushes back nearby monsters. More effective when wearing a shield. Trained by being attacked on all sides.

## Subclasses

The different subclasses train in some skills more easily than others.

### Knight

A master of armed combat, knights are quick to learn Vigor, Combat, Weapon Mastery, and Slaying. They are slow to learn Toughness, Regeneration, Immunity and Endurance as they rely on armor for those. They are terrible at Fighting.

### Barbarian

Drawn from the uncivilized wilds by the lure of fame and fortune, barbarians are huge hulking warriors. They consider heavy armor laughable at best, and refuse to wear anything more than light leather armor. This gives them the extra freedom of movement to be able to wield a one handed weapon in each hand and use them simultaneously when not wielding a shield.

Barbarians are unparalleled at Fighting and Toughness. They easily learn Immunity, Regeneration, Endurance, and Courage.

### Archer

Archers are lightning fast when wielding a bow. They get two shots per round initially, and gain an additional shot every five levels. In order to move this fast, though, they must refrain from wearing heavy armor, shields, or gloves.

They gain weapon skill slowly in every class except missile weapons, which they of course gain rapidly.

### Smith

Smiths are trained in the making and maintenance of all manner of weapons and armor. While they can't actually create equipment without a forge, they take excellent care of their own gear. A smith will periodically clean up identified equipment they are wearing and carrying, improving its strike, damage, or armor bonus by a point. This happens randomly, with equipment with the lowest bonuses being more likely to be fixed. This can raise the bonus to a maximum of half of the character's level.

Being more at home in a forge, smiths gain weapon skill more slowly than warrior classes, especially with two handed weapons. They are fairly adept at bludgeoning weapons, however.

With their superior knowledge of arms, they are able to identify equipment much faster that other warriors. A high-level smith can usually identify an item as soon as it is picked up.
