I've been thinking about how the game doesn't feel very compelling right now. It
doesn't have that addicting feeling of making me want to play one more session.
Some of this not recapitulates the previous "playthrough fun" note, but I had
some thoughts:

## Control versus anticipation

In the previous note, I assume that playthrough-scale fun in the game is
derived from the player having some level of intention and control over how
their character develops. I think that's true, but I think there's another
equally important aspect of *anticipation* of *known* things in the future.

When I'm itching to play Angband, it's usually because there is some milestone
I'm looking forward to reaching:

*   Running into Farmer Maggot and his good drop.
*   Finding the Phial.
*   Reaching the level to cast Identify.
*   Unlocking other good spells.
*   Reaching stat gain depths.

In all of those, there's no *choice* involved. It's just knowing that it will
happen. So while randomness and player agency are important, I think
anticipation of known fixed events is important too.

That anticipation helps connect multiple playthroughs together: when you learn
some fixed lore of the game, even if that character dies, it's still useful
knowledge for later playthroughs.

## Artifacts

I've been debating random versus authored artifacts, and this observation makes
me think the right answer is authored artifacts. (Or both.)

So I think a good set of hand-authored artifacts will help create some play
structure that spans multiple playthroughs.

## Areas

Likewise, themed areas can help both anticipation and agency.

Anticipation because the set of areas and their themes are hand-chosen and named
so the player can look forward to unlocking different areas and exploring them
again in subsequent playthroughs.

Agency because the player can choose which areas to play. Different areas can
focus on different kinds of loot and monsters. We could even have bosses at the
end of areas with specific kinds of drops. Sort of quest-like.

## Unlocking areas

To unlock access to new areas, maybe we could have some kind of "portal rune"
item. If you find a portal rune for an area, it permanently unlocks access to
that area. Those runes can sometimes be found randomly. But also certain
monsters (likely uniques) may be very likely or guaranteed to drop a certain
one, so that some uniques work like gates to reach new areas.

This mixes randomness, agency, and anticipation: You don't know when you'll get
the chance to try a new area. When it unlocks, you look forward to it because
you've been there in previous playthroughs. And you get to choose whether or
when you try that area.

## Quests

If we introduce quests, that can tie into these. Quests grant an item on
completion, and some quests could grant portal runes for different areas.
