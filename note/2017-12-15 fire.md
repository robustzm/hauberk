A tile has a flame counter to indicate how much longer it will continue to burn.
When zero, the tile is not on fire. If fire occurs on the tile (like a fire
spell) then it may set that counter, based on:

- If the tile is of a flammable type, like a bridge, then the type indicates
  what to set the counter to, and what to change the type to as it burns. So a
  bridge would set the flame counter and would turn into a water tile after.

- If the tile contains a flammable item, the item is destroyed and the counter
  is set.

- Some spells or items may directly add to the tile's flame counter. They
  effectively pour fuel onto the tile.

In the latter two cases, the type of the tile may prohibit or reduce the amount
the flame counter can be increased. For example, water tiles can't have flame
on them.

Each turn of the game loop, we iterate over each flaming tile and decrement its
flame counter. If it reaches zero, the flame goes out. Otherwise, for each
neighbor of the flaming tile, there is a random chance of fire spreading to
that tile using the same above conditions. The random chance is based on the
flame counter so that fires with a lot of fuel are also more likely to spread.
