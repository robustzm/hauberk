Character building and progression can be more fun and interesting if the
choices of equipment and skills are interdependent and, uh, synergistic.

Obviously, a shield that increases strength is good for a warrior that uses
melee weapons a lot, but I think it's worth trying to think through more
complex interactions between gear and stats.

I really like the idea that finding an item might lead to a cascading series of
changes in other equipment. I want later-in-the-game players to agonize (but in
a rewarding way) about which gear to equip.

I want players to decide to take their hero's skill progression in a totally
different direction if they stumble upon a particularly interesting piece of
gear.

It would be very cool if the set of equiped items felt a bit like a
machine-building board game where they harmonize in complex ways.

Some ideas for equipment effects:

-   Speed up mana/focus/whatever regeneration to improve spellcaster's casting
    rate. Examples: A Staff of Wizardry that speeds mana regeneration. A Wand of
    Necromancy that lowers the cost of necromancy spells.

-   Use the value of one stat to affect the bonus of another (either positively
    or negatively). Examples: A Helm of Brawn that adds +1 to Strength for
    every point of Intellect *below* 15. Boots of Nimbleness that set Strength
    and Agility to whichever is higher.

-   Increase some stat based on the number of other equipped items with some
    property. Example: An Amulet of the Elves that increases Intellect by one
    point for every piece of "Elven" gear worn.

-   Set equipment where the effect only kicks in if you also have other gear in
    the set. Examples: The Short Sword "Fire" and the Short Sword "Brimstone".
    If both are wielded simultaneously, they fire brand and do +X damage.

-   Antagonistic gear that loses effect if you have some other kind of gear
    equipped. Examples: Elven armor that doesn't work if you also have Dwarven
    armor equipped, a Swashbucker's Sabre that improves parrying but only if
    you don't have a shield equipped.

-   Gear which lowers heft of other gear enabling you to wear heavier stuff.

-   Gear which drains some resource like health, mana, or experience but
    provides powerful effects otherwise and can be countered with other
    equipment that prevent or remediate the drain. Example: Vampiric Spire is
    a spear that drains one health every turn but does a ton of damage. If an
    item of regeneration is also equipped, you can get away with it.

-   Sustain gear that prevents lowering of stats, so you can combine it with
    other gear that would otherwise lower it.

In general, the most powerful gear and artifacts should often involve some sort
of trade-off or compromise.
