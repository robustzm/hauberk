There's no real reason to be conservative about what kinds of terrain and
biomes that appear in the dungeon. Want a big room that contains a teeming
jungle? Why not? It's *magic*.

We should embrace the genre. The dungeon isn't literally a Medieval stonework
jail. It's a sprawling supernatural creation, a magical universe unto itself.

It's good to have regions that obey their own internal logic -- churches
containing priests, laboratories full of potions, selkies in lakes, etc. That
gives the player a sense of place, builds expectations, and helps them navigate
those regions.

But there's no need to say "a ___ wouldn't appear in a real dungeon". You know
what else didn't appear in real dungeons in the Middle Ages? *Dragons.* Yet here
we are.
