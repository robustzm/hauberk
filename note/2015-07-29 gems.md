Things gems could do:

1.  Upgrade equipment to the next better version: dirk -> dagger, etc.
2.  Choose a random affix with a chance of failure
3.  Choose a specific affix
4.  Turn equipment into a unique artifact-like equipment. (in other words, an
    item with a distinct name and powers, not just regular item + affix)
