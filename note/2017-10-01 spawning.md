Things to take into account when spawning items and monsters and decorations:

- Distance from hero's starting point.
- Whether the room is on an isolated path or not, and its distance.
- Biome and terrain within the biome (water versus shore).
- Depth.
- Density. Some biomes may want to spawn stuff more than others.

Different potential ways stuff can be spawned:

- Simply pick a random item and drop it.

- Pick a random monster and drop it.

- Create an "encounter" that's a batch of monsters, items and decorations and
  spawn that at a random location.

- Smart encounters that try to place themselves in an area that makes sense for
  the thing being spawned -- some monsters might hug walls, etc.

- Encounters that take over and theme an entire room -- a laboratory gets
  furniture, magic items, spellcasting monsters, etc.

- Brogue-like "machines" where some larger scale narrative and placement goes
  on. For example, locking away a room and placing the key elsewhere. Having a
  treasure room protected by guards. An altar that triggers a summon, etc.

Figuring out which we need and how they interact is the tricky part. Simpler is
good because it can lead to more combinatorial complexity, and it's easier to
maintain.

The more complex ones can make the dungeon feel more meaningful but run the
risk of it feeling *too* scripted and canned.

The right answer is probably a mixture of a few of these.
