Trying to figure out what attributes Hauberk should have and what they should
do. From Angband:

Int/Wis (depending on whether mage or priest):
- Number of spells per level
- Amount of mana per level
- Minimum spell fail chance

Intelligence:
- Ability to use magical devices like wands
- Ability to disarm traps

Wisdom:
- Saving throw

Strength:
- Damage
- To-hit
- Wieldable weapon weight
- Attacks per round
- Total carrying capacity
- Bonus to digging

Dexterity:
- To-hit
- Armor class (basically dodge ability)
- Chance to disarm traps
- Chance to evade theft
- Reduce chance of being stunned bashing

Constitution:
- HP per level
- Ability to recover from poison, stunning, cuts

Here's what I have in mind ("+" is implemented already):

Strength:
+ Heft for which weapons can be wielded effectively.
+ Cancels out strength cost of weight from armor.
+ Modifies range when tossing items.
- Modify damage? Heft may be enough to cover this.
- Resist pushback or getting blown by air?

Agility:
+ Dodge bonus.
+ Strike bonus.
- Something to do with stealth?
- Resist pushback or getting blown by air?

Fortitude:
+ Maximum health.
- Affect poison duration or intensity?

Intellect:
- Maximum focus.
- Better searching for hidden stuff?
- Better ability to resist some mental attacks like confusion, illusion, etc.?
- Better ability to use scrolls?

Will:
- Amount of focus lost when hit.
- Something to do with priest-type heroes?
