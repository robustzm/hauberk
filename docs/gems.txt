things gems could do:

1. upgrade equipment to the next better version: dirk -> dagger, etc.
2. choose a random affix with a chance of failure
3. choose a specific affix
4. turn equipment into a unique artifact-like equipment. (in other words, an
   item with a distinct name and powers, not just regular item + affix)
