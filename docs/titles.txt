I like classes because knowing your character is a named archetype is a big
part of the fantasy feel for me. However, designing, coding, and balancing a
bunch of different classes and their mechanics is a lot of work. Also, it can
make loot a lot less useful. If you pick warrior and then discover a powerful
magic book on the first level, it's a wasted opportunity.

This is why Brogue doesn't have classes -- it encourages players to be
opportunistic and incrementally specialize their character's skills based on
what the dungeon gives them.

One option is to do something like that. Instead of classes, have a big tree
of skills that characters can learn and improve.

To get back the feel of archetypes, the game will assign a title to the
character based on which skills they have and their levels. So, for example,
"mage" might be someone who's best skill is spellcasting but still isn't very
high level.

Figuring out how map skill levels to titles is a little tricky. Maybe for each
skill we could have a hidden scale factor for each title that maps points in
that skill to points towards that title. Whichever title has the most scaled
points wins.

We could make titles a little more interesting by having them confer a bonus
of some sort to the player -- maybe an extra ability or a bonus levels in some
skills.

Another option is to do what Crawl does and make your class be a package of
starting skills and equipment.
