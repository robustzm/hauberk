Members of the priest class derive their power from their faith. Through faithful worship of their deity or higher power, their are granted supernatural abilities. Being a priest requires great sacrifice in order to show worthiness. Priests are only allowed the use of very specific weapons and armor, and do not practice magic in the manner of mages. In return, they are granted divine intervention in order to aid them.

## Play Style

Priests want the power of magic that mages have (more in fact) without all of the nit-picky academia assocatied with mages. Much of a priests power comes from granted powers given by their deity. when a deity answers a priests prayers, it's usually in a manner more powerful than mage spells, but less predictable. For example, while a mage would cast lightning bolt which simply damages an enemy, a priest may summon a monster which will then (hopefully) attack the chosen target.

Priests want the power to wield magic without having to spend as much time determining which spells to learn and cast.

Priests have *piety* a statistic which represents how much favor the priests currently has with their deity. Doing things the deity approves of increases it. Forcing the deity to answer prayers lowers it. As it gets lower, the chance of the deity deigning to answer increases. The player can roughly get an idea of the current piety, but does not know it precisely.
