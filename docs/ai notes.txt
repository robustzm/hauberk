high level intent:
- get to melee distance
  - pick walk direction
    - find path to hero and use that
    - else see if we have los to hero and use that
    - else see if we have a scent and use that
    - else go in general direction (i.e. sound)
- run away (to heal? to escape?)
- get to missile distance: not too close but with los
- melee attack
- use missile attack
- other moves like heal, teleport, etc.

q: how does monster determine intent?
- moves limit: if it doesn't have any missile attacks, it won't try to do that
- current health: if close to death, more likely to run or prefer missile
- strength of attacks: more likely to prefer melee or missile based on which is
  most powerful
- recharge: more likely to prefer cheaper moves
- damage: if losing health quickly, more likely to run. if taking a lot of
  melee damage, more likely to prefer missile attacks, and vice versa
