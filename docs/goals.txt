One way to figure out how to balance the game and fill in content is to think
about what the player's near term goals are at various points during a full
playthrough (aside from the ever-present "levelling"). This depends on what
kinds of monsters they'll be dealing with at various depths, so coming up with
this list is equivalent to deciding monsters, and vice versa.

At a high level, I'm thinking much of the game blends a few goals:

- Amass and maintain a stockpile of increasingly powerful consumables, the best
  of which are saved for the final boss and other high level uniques.

- Acquiring a set of equipment to cover as many resistances and conditions as
  possible.

- Getting gear to maximize speed and other combat boosts.

- Maxing out level and skills. (And stats if we add them?)

That's basically it. Level up, buff yourself with gear, build a trove of
consumables, and you're ready to kill the boss.

This assumes the player has complete lore knowledge of the game. If that's not
the case, there's also a lot of *learning* about all of the different items and
monsters.

Here's a more detailed progression:

- Get some basic armor in each slot.
- Build up a stock of small healing, antidote, and escape items.

...

- Start transitioning to more powerful healing, etc. items how that max health
  is higher.

...

- Max out level.
- Ensure all resistances are covered, preferrably at power >=2.
- Kill final boss.

One way to think about balacing monsters and items in the dungeon is by how they
pair up. Different monster moves and behaviors lend themselves to different
items to help defeat them. So a player's intermediate goals are often ensuring
they have certain items and equipment before they reach a depth where certain
styles of monsters show up.

Here are some:

- Obviously, you want resistances to elements before you run into strong attacks
  with that element. This is especially true for elements with nasty side
  effects.
- You want strong armor (and high health) before running into monsters that
  dish out a lot of damage.
- You want to have some form of ranged attack before you encounter a lot of
  shy monsters that avoid melee and focus on ranged moves.
- You want to resist or cure poison before running into poisoners.
- You want to resist or cure other conditions (sleep, confuse, etc.) before
  running into monsters that cause them.
- You want some kind of area attacks before running into lots of group monsters,
  especially group monsters that try to avoid melee.
