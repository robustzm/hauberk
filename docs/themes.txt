Here's an idea for how to get regions and stuff in the dungeon to feel locally
consistent and to get a feel for "I'm heading towards an area of ___".

We can have a grid of "theme" data for the stage. Biomes can seed that with
base themes like "water".

When a monster is spawned, it may prefer to be in certain themes. (Or,
conversely, when choosing a monster to spawn, we take the theme of the place
into account.) When a monster is placed, it may paint some of the surrounding
area with its own theme. So spawning an undead monster will taint the nearby
area. Later spawns in the region are more likely to also be undead.

Floor drops and furnishings take theme into account in their weights. Likewise,
a furnishing may also paint theme. A laboratory decoration paints a "magical"
theme which makes magic-using monsters more likely to spawn.
