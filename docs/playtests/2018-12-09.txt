+ Managed to get two barrels completely blocking a corridor.

- Some kind of minimap would be nice, or at least a meter of how much of the
  level has been explored.

- Antidotes are common enough that poison doesn't feel like much of a threat.

- In order to prevent the hero from lurking in a corridor and picking off
  monsters one at a time, it might be good for some monsters to be smart enough
  to detect that case. If:

  - The hero only has one reachable open neighboring tile.
  - There are multiple nearby monsters.
  - The hero hasn't done ranged attacks.

  Then a monster with the right "flanking" AI flag won't get within melee range
  in order to try to draw the hero out.
