- Treasure and healing too rare.

- Teleport too rare.

- No UI to tell how much headroom have with strength when buying armor. (Maybe
  show weight in item list?)

- Have to eat too often.

- Leveling feels slow.

- Dark grey monsters and items blend into the background on well-lit tiles.

- Don't show wake "!" effect if monster is killed.
