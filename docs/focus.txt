Some constraints and goals around how focus interacts with melee:

- A pure archery character should be able to unleash non-stop arrows, but get
  fatigued quickly if they run into melee combat. A more balanced ranger like
  character can dish out ranged attacks but recover quickly in mixed melee
  combat.

- A pure mage can unleash a lot of magical damage quickly but is rendered
  useless if monsters get in close. A pure mage's spells are fantastically
  powerful compared to other hero styles. The limitations around focus and melee
  combat exist to balance that out some. If mages could put out those spells and
  also not suffer in melee, they would be overpowered.

- In order to get the most powerful spells, a hero must commit to that hero
  style at the expense of other styles. The requirements need to be high.

- A "battle mage" can do OK-but-not-great magical damage but is more resilient
  to melee combat and can even reliably use magic while in close quarters. They
  sacrifice some of the mage's more powerful spell potential by being less
  screwed if monsters get in close.

- A warrior, compared to magic-using types, can freely wade into melee without
  as much worry.

- There's maybe something interesting to explore around different hero styles
  and how they interact with battle duration. Maybe some heroes can dump a ton
  of damage into monsters quickly but if the battle isn't over by then, they
  are spent and screwed. Others are more marathon fighters.

Here's the mechanics I aleady have in place:

- Focus is the primary resource that gets drained for commands that require
  mental concentration. Archery, lock-picking, spells, etc. It recharges while
  resting.

- Unlike MP in other games, focus is also drained when taking damage. At first,
  it drains very quickly. Getting hit "breaks your concentration".

Given all that, here are a few ideas around mechanics and skills:

- Training focus-spending skills lowers the amount of focus using the skill
  costs.

- Intellect determines maximum focus. It's sort of how much you can hold in
  your head at one time. Some powerful spells consume so much focus that you
  have to train intellect significantly in order to be able to cast the spell
  at all. (This also implies you can't use these very powerful spells more than
  once or so in a battle.)

  If resting regains focus at a steady percentage of max focus, this also
  implies that training intellect improves focus regeneration speed.

- Will reduces the amount of focus lost when getting hit or otherwise
  distracted. It's your ability to retain focused despite what's going on around
  you. Instead of a separate ability, this could be a "Concentration" skill
  under Intellect.

- Spell school skills (divination, necromancy, etc.) lower the focus cost of
  all spells in that school.

- Spell skills get more powerful as you train them.

- Spells/items to temporarily improve concentration/will.
