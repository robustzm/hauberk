Right now, weapons are basically a glorified number. Any weapon whose power is
lower than yours is total junk.

That's lame. Here's some ideas to make them interesting:

- Different weapon types have different attack patterns. Axes hit a few
  adjacent tiles. Spears hit a few in a row. Whips target a few tiles out.

- Daggers do extra damage to sleeping monsters.

- Bludgeons knockback.

- Wands do no melee attack at all but are wielded by spellcasters to improve
  skills. Or maybe they work like ranged weapons? Some of both?

- Swords can be used to parry the next attack. Or maybe weapons that parry just
  increase the player's dodge score?

- Skills for weapon aptitude encourage players to focus on a single type.

- If we don't want all actions to take the same amount of time, we could make
  some weapons faster than others.
