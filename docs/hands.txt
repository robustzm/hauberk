I've been thinking around how hands and equipment should work. There are a
couple of things I have in mind:

*   The way light sources work is kind of random and hacky where it just takes
    the brightest thing hanging out in your inventory.

*   Some kind of dual-wielding could make for interesting equipment variety.

*   It seems weird that you can wield a giant two-handed weapon and a shield at
    the same time.

My plan for resolving this is to treat the hero's hands as a resource. You have
two hand slots to fill, and you can fill them with:

*   One slot for a single-handed weapon.
*   Both slots for a two-handed weapon.
*   A held light source.
*   A shield.

You can do combinations like:

*   A weapon in each hand.
*   A single-handed weapon in one hand and a light source.
*   A single-handed weapon and a shield.
*   A two-handed weapon.

## Features

This opens up some questions and problems:

### Dual wielding

#### Hits

If you have two weapons equipped, how does that interact with melee combat?
Does the player use each weapon independently as separate actions? Does using
both take two turns or just one?

One idea I had was that if you have two weapons wielded, then attacking only
consumes half the energy. In other words, it makes an attack take half the time.
I don't think that's the right approach. In general, I think it's a good
simplification for players that all turns take the same amount of time. I'd
have to tweak the entire energy system to be able to correctly handle a
half-time attack when the hero is already moving at the highest possible speed.

Also, it would cause some weird consequences. Imagine the player is wielding
one really good weapon and one crappy one. They do one attack with the good one.
Now it's their turn. If the game lets them choose which weapon they use each
turn, then putting a random weapon in the off hand becomes a hack to let you
just use the other weapon twice as fast. That doesn't feel right.

If we don't do that, the game has to track which weapon/hand you're allowed to
attack with next. So after using the good weapon, it needs some internal state
that forces the next melee attack to toggle to the other hand. But, then, how
does that interact with equipping/unequipping? This bit of hidden state feels
weird and confusing.

Given that, I think a better option is to have a single melee attack action hit
with both weapons at once. It should be fairly straightforward to extend
AttackAction to get a list of hits from the attacker and perform them all. We
could even possibly extend monsters to use that, though I think it's probably
not that useful. Each weapon could have side effects, but the action system
already handles a queue of pending effects, so that should work.

#### Heft

Weapon heft is a strength requirement. Dual-wielding should affect that. If
you're just barely strong enough to wield a sword without penalty, you shouldn't
be able to wield two of them without penalty.

I considered having weapons subtract your strength like weight does. Then
weapon heft scaling would be become a flat scale based on strength instead of
centered on the weapon's heft. But that doesn't feel right to me. Wielding a
heavy weapon shouldn't affect everything else that strength touches. I could be
wrong about this, though. Strength actually isn't used for much else.

The option I'm currently leaning towards is to scale heft when weapons are dual
wielded. So each weapon's heft is the strength requirement when it's the only
weapon wielded. If you wield two, both weapons have their heft scaled using
some formula. I don't want to hand author two heft values for each weapon, but
I think it should be doable to come up with a simple formula to calculate the
dual-wield heft from the base one.

#### Disciplines

It would be good to have a discipline or two around dual wielding. A simple
option given the above stuff around heft is to have the dual-wield disciplline
modify the heft scaling. At its max level, you could dual wield two weapons as
easily as one.

### Light sources

#### Wielding and using

Right now, candles and torches can be consumed to light an area. This change
means you can equip them. The game doesn't currently support an item that can
be both equipped and used since there's just a single "use" command.

This probably isn't a huge deal. There's already an "e" key binding for showing
the equipment. (Which, now that I think about it, isn't very useful given the
new item sidebar.) So we can just have two commands for using versus equipping.

Another challenge is that we currently assume all equippable items cannot stack.
Candles and torches do stack right now. Options:

*   Do the work to handle stackable equippable items. Equipping should only
    equip one from the stack. Unequipping needs to handle merging. This might
    not be too bad.

*   Not allow light sources to stack. That feels egregious given that you need
    to stock up on them as usable items.

*   Come up with another way to light rooms instead of consuming light sources.

#### Lanterns on belts

Using up a hand for a light source is a big sacrifice. We could also give the
player a belt slot that can be used for a lantern. That would make lanterns a
much more useful item since they don't take up a slot.

### Two-handed weapons

Since two-handed weapons take both hand slots, we should make them more
valuable in other ways. The obvious answer is that they have higher damage than
other weapons. Probably give them relatively lower heft for the amount of
damage they do too, since it takes less strength to use a weapon when you can
put both hands on it.

We could maybe do some kind of skill or subclass title thing to let a strong
hero wield a two-handed weapon in one hand.

### Handed-ness and UI

The UI for equipping stuff in hands can get complicated. Right now, the player
never says *where* to equip something, they just choose *what* to equip. I'd
like to keep that simplicity.

I think we can do that similar to how Angband manages rings. The idea is that
when you equip something that needs a hand, if there's an empty hand, it goes
there. Otherwise, it unequips something (it really doesn't matter which) and
then puts it there instead.

If the player wants to equip it in a specific hand, they can just explicitly
unequip the thing in that hand first to leave the slot empty.

That raises the question of handedness. Should one hand be better for wielding
weapons? For simplicity, I'm currently thinking no. Each hand is equally good.
The only thing that comes into play is that if you dual wield, both hands get
"worse" effectively because the heft of both weapons goes up.

## Bows

I guess bows should be two-handed weapons. Although that means you can't wield
a bow and a light source, which seems annoying. On the other hand, if we make
them single-handed, then we have to handle the case where you wield two bows.
That should definitely be prohibited.

One option is to do what Angband does and have a separate slot for bows. But
that kind of undermines this feature. It also means basically every character
ends up wielding a bow because, even if you never use it, you can still equip
one that has some bonuses.

One goal with Hauberk is that different kinds of characters should have pretty
different equipment. I don't like that end-game Angband characters often all
have the same kit, regardless of class and race.

The simplest option is to say that, yes, bows are two-handed and you can't
carry a light source while wielding one, at least not until you can find a
lantern or some other non-held source of light. That makes ranged weapons more
of a challenge, but that might help balance out the fact that you don't need
ammo for them.

## Changes

OK, so here's the summary of what I think this entails:

+   Give the hero two "hand" slots instead of a "weapon" slot. Weapons go in
    hands.

+   Shields go in hands.

+   Light sources go in hands.

+   The hero's emanation is the sum of all equipment emanation.

+   Make a separate equip/unequip input so that light sources can be used and
    equipped. If a piece of equipment has no use, it's probably best to not
    default to equipping it so that users don't get in that habit and then
    accidentally consume other things that they mean to equip.

+   Handle equipping stackable items. Equipping a stack should split it.

-   Add a belt equipment slot. Lanterns go there. Maybe some other kinds of
    equipment?

+   Make AttackAction handle an Actor returning a list of hits. Hero returns
    two, one for each weapon, if two weapons are wielded.

+   Make heft scaling take dual-wielding into account. If two weapons are
    wielded, the heft for both goes up. Figure out how to show this in the UI
    and what notifications to show.

-   Allow items to be marked as "two-handed". Wielding a two-handed item forces
    the other hand slot to be unused. So it needs to unequip whatever's in the
    other hand. Equipping in a hand slot should check to see if the other hand
    slot already has a two-handed item in it. The equipment list UI should show
    that the slot is unavailable somehow. Maybe show the two-handed item in the
    second slot too, but grayed out?

-   Add a discipline for dual-wielding that reduces the heft penalty.

-   Eventually maybe add a subclass/title for wielding a two-handed weapon in
    one hand?

-   Tweak weapon stats so that two-handed weapons do more damage and have lower
    heft.

-   Make bows two-handed.

+   Show both weapons in sidebar.
