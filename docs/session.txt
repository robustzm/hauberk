I need to figure out what a single play session in the dungeon is about. Right
now, it's aimless wandering while accruing some stuff and XP.

When is the player allowed to leave the level? Do they need to find stairs or
kill a boss?

How do they get a sense that they are exploring *towards* something? Can we
foreshadow what they might find? Level feeling from Angband was cool for that.
Is there anything goal-directed about the way they wander the level?

Foreshadowing in the dungeon could help:

- If you get within a certain range of some monsters, randomly get a message
  like "you hear a low growl to the north", etc.

- When placing monsters, place some nearby accoutrements that hint at them.
  Puddles of slime near slimes, burn marks near dragons, etc.

- Consumables and spells of detection are always nice to let people know what's
  out there. The late game in Angband is a lot of fun when you cast detect
  monsters and see a huge pit of them.

- If we do light with good simulated glow from it, odd-colored light might hint
  at something unusual around the corner.

- Regions in the dungeon should help. Seeing a bit of cavern or grass implies
  there is more ahead and that it's not a single random patch.

Maybe we could let the player leave whenever they want, but they only unlock
access to the next depth if they achieve some goal -- kill boss, find stairs,
etc.

I think it's OK if the player doesn't know *what* they are headed towards. The
mystery alone can draw them forward, as long as they have a sense that there is
a good chance they are headed towards *something* interesting.
