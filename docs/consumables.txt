A good variety of consumables lets players find a lot of loot without giving
them a pile of permanent goods. Here's some ideas:

- Magic mapping at various distances from the player.
- Detect monsters at various distances and maybe of various kinds.
  "Detect evil, etc."
- Curing various conditions: cold, blindness, dazzle, etc. Combinations thereof.
- "Bomb-like" items that do real damage or a ball attack when tossed.
- Time bombs that get dropped on the ground and explode after a few turns.
- Bolt, ball, etc. attacks.
- Temporary resists, individually and in various combinations and intensities.
- If we add stats, potions to permanently raise stats or swap them.
- Healing at various intensities.
- More targeted kinds of teleportation?
- Banish monsters.
- Teleport other.
- Recipe ingredients for improving equipment.
- Causing conditions on monsters: cold, blind, confuse, sleep, etc. Various
  distances, chance of success.
- Detect stairs.
- Frighten monsters.
- Modify the level: stone to mud, create wall, create door, etc. Glyph of
  warding?
- Turn monster(s) to stone. They are "killed" but become impassable walls.
  (Need to add digging to game to avoid hero getting stuck.)
- See through walls.
- Teleport item to hero.
- Polymorph monster.
- Polymorph item?
- Create random item.
- Gain experience.
- Potions that raise fury, sustain it, and trade health for it.
