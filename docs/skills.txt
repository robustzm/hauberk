Skills. Similar to skill trees in Diablo.

Each time you level up, you gain <n> points that you can spend leveling up
skills. Skills start at level zero and may have a maximum level. In addition,
most skills have preconditions: these are minimum levels of other skills. You
can only gain a skill whose preconditions are met.

Most skills only have a single precondition, which makes it roughly tree-like,
but some have more than one, so it's really a skill digraph.

Skill points can not generally be reassigned, but there is rare potion that
enables it.
