A **furnishing** is a little blob of content that may be placeable within a room or other generated area of the dungeon. It has a few components:

-   The **template** is a 2D grid of cells that defines the furnishing's
    appearance and requirements. In code, the template is a string literal with
    a character for each cell. Then there is one or more **styles** that defines
    what each character means.

    Each cell can be one of:

    -   A **requirement.** It states what kind of tile must already exist at
        that point in the dungeon in order to place the furnishing on top of it.
        Requirements can be specific to certain tile types, or general such as
        "must be open here" or "must be a wall".

    -   A **tile.** A specific kind of tile. If the furnishing is successfully
        placed, this is what gets put on the stage at that cell. A simple tile
        specifies only a tile type. More complex ones may also specify drops
        that are placed, or monsters that are spawned.

        A single tile may also have one or more options that can be selected
        from randomly. **TODO: Do we need this? Can nested furnishings cover
        it?**

-   A (possibly empty) list of inner furnishings. These are other furnishings
    that may be randomly chosen and placed within this one's bounds if this one
    is successfully placed. For example, a table may have inner furnishings for
    candles or other decoration.

In order to place a furnishing:

1.  Pick a random furnishing. It's weighted by the depth, the rarity of the
    furnishing and perhaps other dungeon theming.

2.  Try to find a location to place it. Iterate over all of the coordinates
    within the place's bounding box where the furnishing's bounding box could
    fit. For each, look at the existing tiles and see if they meet every
    corresponding cell's requirement.

    It multiple locations meet the requirements, pick one randomly.

3.  Pick a random style for the furnishing. The styles may have weights and
    the theme may affect these too.

4.  Place the furnishing. Go through its cells and set any tile types, drops,
    and spawns appropriately.

5.  If the furnishing has nested furnishings, recursively process those.
