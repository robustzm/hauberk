Things to show in UI:

With 10x12 font, laptop is about 141x54 chars.

Stage view area is currently 60x34.
Log is 60x6.
Sidebar is 20x40.

Could do three columns:
- 40 chars
  - Hero info
  - Nearby monster stat bars
  - Recent monster or item info
  - Minimap?
- 60 chars
  - Gameplay
  - Current tile description
  - Log
- 40 chars
  - Equipment
  - Inventory
  - Skill quick keys?

Can show inventory and equipment without "a)" part for normal viewing, and
somewhat truncated if needed. Then when the user chooses a command, those panels
slide out to be larger and add the letters for selection.

If display isn't wide enough right column is completely dropped.

As display gets shorter, trim minimap, skill quick keys, and log rows.
