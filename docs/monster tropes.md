Trying to think about some of the monster categories and what sorts of
interesting moves and behavior they should have:

## Insubstantials and wraiths

As the name implies, ghosts and spirits should be able to walk through walls.
The motility stuff should handle that easily, though we'll need to add another
motility to distinguish the edges of the dungeon which should be impassable
even for ghosts. We'll likely need that for destructibility anyway.

Cause fear?

Invisibility, either all the time or some of the time.

Can't be harmed by regular items. This may be as simple as having them resist
the None element.

## Demons

These are semi-divine so some interacton with the deity system would be
interesting.

Demonic possession is a common trope. Perhaps a demon could possess the hero
and take control of them for a while.

Lots of associations with fire, so fire attacks.

Hexes and curses to cause bad things to happen to people in the future.

Pentagrams and other enscribed sigils.

Summoning should be a big part. Demons can summon lesser demons. Maybe certain
player actions (stepping on a sigil?) could cause demons to be summoned.

## Nagas

Not too much, but perhaps shape-shifting between snake, human, and hybrid forms
with different stats and moves for each.

## Elementals

They should be immune to their element, and also not avoid it as a substance.
Making sure all the elements have good side effects and substances is important.

Being particularly weak against certain elements would be good too. Water
should do extra damage to fire elementals.

Perhaps substances could spontaneously generate elementals sometimes?

## Hybrids

Some kind of petrification for cockatrices and medusa.

## Vampires

Some sort of "life draining". Could be draining experience or lowering stats.

A really interesting mechanic would be to have it possible for the player to
be turned into a vampire with certain restrictions and bonuses.

Harmed by light. AI should avoid lit areas.

Harmed by wooden weapons?

## Zombies

Slow-moving, almost always in groups.

Relentless, so maybe they never fall asleep once alerted?

Like vampires, could getting bitten by a zombie turn you into one?

In some areas, they could crawl out of the ground.

## Lichs and other undead

Maybe cause disease?

Have some that explode when you hit them.

## Dragons

This is mostly there with breath attacks. Just need to author them. They should
resist their element.

Special boss rooms to generate them surrounded by treasure.

## Krakens and hydras

We need to figure out how water tiles work with the hero. Is there swimming or
flying? How does combat with aquatic monsters work?

## Mushrooms

Cause hallucinations. Release spores.

## Trolls

## Xorns

Destroy walls.

## Ancients

Warp reality in some way? Destroying the dungeon. Maybe other weird perceptive
effects?

Teleport the hero to and from them.
