- Move tryAdd() out of ItemCollection and Equipment? Only needed for home and
  crucible, I think?
- BoltMove does not pass its range to BoltAction. Probably OK since monster
  won't choose move if out of range, but means action can go farther than
  intended range.

Playtest 2018/11/16:

- Treasure and healing too rare.

- Teleport too rare.

- No UI to tell how much headroom have with strength when buying armor. (Maybe
  show weight in item list?)

- Have to eat too often.

- Leveling feels slow.

- Dark grey monsters and items blend into the background on well-lit tiles.

- Don't show wake "!" effect if monster is killed.

Playtest 2018/12/04:

- Treasure could be more common, at least early on.

- Imps seem to run up to melee too much given that they have a ranged attack.
  Most monsters seem to have same walking behavior. Should have more variety.

- Food not common enough on level 1.
