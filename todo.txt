- Move tryAdd() out of ItemCollection and Equipment? Only needed for home and
  crucible, I think?
- BoltMove does not pass its range to BoltAction. Probably OK since monster
  won't choose move if out of range, but means action can go farther than
  intended range.

-- From playtesting 2018/11/16:

- dungeons too big and dense
  probably make keeps rarer and dungeons more common with less density

- treasure and healing too rare

- equipment too common

- teleport too rare

- no ui to tell how much headroom have with strength when buying armor
  (maybe show weight in item list?)

- have to eat too often

- leveling feels slow

- monsters drop a lot of loot, especially when dropping equipment

- dark grey monsters and items blend into the background on well-lit tiles

- don't show wake "!" effect if monster is killed
