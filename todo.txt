- Move tryAdd() out of ItemCollection and Equipment? Only needed for home and
  crucible, I think?
- BoltMove does not pass its range to BoltAction. Probably OK since monster
  won't choose move if out of range, but means action can go farther than
  intended range.

-- From playtesting 2018/11/16:

- can get hatchet very early and it does 18 damage with relatively low heft
  really overpowered

- dungeons too big and dense
  probably make keeps rarer and dungeons more common with less density

- treasure and healing too rare

- equipment too common

- teleport too rare

- gloves show up at level 3 but are worth a lot of cash

- no ui to tell how much headroom have with strength when buying armor
  (maybe show weight in item list?)

- dungeon way too dark

- have to eat too often

- bows are still unusable

- crows feel overpowered -- fast, group, decent damage

- leveling feels slow

- fur-lined robe has same armor as leather shirt. how do weight and cost
  compare?

- darkness means majority of time when hit by ranged attack, comes out of
  darkness. not very fun

- monsters drop a lot of loot, especially when dropping equipment

- dark grey monsters and items blend into the background on well-lit tiles
