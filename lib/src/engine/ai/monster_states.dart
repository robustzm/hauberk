/*

monster has "mood", which describes how it's feeling:
- how afraid
- how bored
- other stuff?

those change over time based on stimulus:
- los with hero decreases boredom
- hearing hero decreases boredom
- no los with hero increases boredom
- seeing hero take damage decreases fear
- taking damage increases fear
- seeing hero inflict damage increases fear
- just seeing hero's health increases fear?
- being bored decreases fear

monster also has set of moves it can perform, and it can reason about them
in ai:
- knows which moves are ranged attacks
- knows element move uses for attack

mood and moves are then used to determine goal:
- melee attack hero
- sleep
- flee
- get in position for ranged attack
- use other move

when goal is attack:
- tries to find path to get to hero
- if has haste, will likely use it
- if can teleport to, will likely use it
- hits if adjacent

when goal is flee:
- tries to find path to nearest tile that is not visible to hero
- if has healing move may use it
- if has haste, may use it
- if can teleport away, will likely use it
- if cornered, attacks

when goal is get in position for ranged attack:
- tries to find path to nearest range position. good range position is:
  - not too far from hero
  - not too close
  - has open los to hero
- if in position, uses ranged move
- distance range is based on
  - strength of melee attacks
  - strength of ranged attacks
  - cost of ranged attacks
  - fear
  - recharge

other stuff:
- semi-intelligent monsters should learn hero resists by seeing which moves
  are ineffective
- intelligent monsters do same, but take into account moves *other* monsters
  do if they can see hero when it happens
- omniscient monsters just know hero's weaknesses
- all but stupidest monsters won't use move that applies condition currently
  in effect
- stupid monsters don't pathfind as well

- would be nice to have a state for assisting other monsters

different ways monsters handle fear:
- cowardly: easily frightened when hurt or others are
- protective: frightened when hurt, emboldened when others (esp weaker) are
- stoic: not easily frightened
- selfish: easily frightened when hurt, not when others are
- berzerk: emboldened when hurt or others are

courage level examples:
- creeper vine: too dumb to be afraid at all
- cockroach: too dumb to be afraid almost all the time
- raven: "normal" fear response
- mangy cur: easily frightened
- scurrilous imp: very easily frightened
