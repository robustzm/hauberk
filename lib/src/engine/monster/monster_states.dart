/// This defines the monster AI. AI is broken into a three level hierarchy.
///
/// The top sort-of level is the monster's "mood". This is a set of variables
/// that describe how the monster is "feeling". How afraid they are, how bored
/// they are, etc. These are the monster's senses and memory.
///
/// At the beginning of each turn, the monster uses these and some hysteresis
/// to determine it's *state*, which is how their mood manifests in behavior.
/// Where the "fear" mood fluctuates every turn, only when it reaches a high
/// enough point to trigger a transition to the "afraid" *state* does its
/// behavior change.
///
/// Most monsters the hero is interacting with are in the "awake" state.
/// Monsters off in the distances are usually asleep. Other states may be added
/// later: confused, blind, charmed, etc.
///
/// When awake, the monster has to decide what to do. It has a few options:
///
/// - It can perform a [Move], which are the "special" things different breeds
///   can do: teleportation, bolt attacks, etc.
/// - It can try to walk up to the hero and engage in melee combat.
/// - If it has a ranged attack move, it can try to get to a good vantage point
///   (not near the hero but still in range, with open LOS) and use a ranged
///   move.
///
/// Each move carries with it a little bit of logic to determine if it's a good
/// idea to use it. For example, the HealMove won't let itself be used if the
/// monster is at max health. In order to use a move, the monster must be
/// "recharged". Each move has a cost, and after using it, the monster must
/// recharge before another move can be performed. (Melee attacks have no cost.)
///
/// If a monster is recharged and does have a usable move, it will always prefer
/// to do that first. Once it's got no moves to do, it has to determine how it
/// wants to fight.
///
/// To choose between melee and ranged attacks, it decides how "cautious" it is.
/// The more damaging its ranged attacks are relative to melee, the more
/// cautious it is. Greater fear and lower health also make it more cautious.
/// If caution is above a threshold, the monster will prefer a ranged attack.
///
/// To get in position for that, it pathfinds to the nearest tile that's in
/// range and has an open line of sight to the hero. Checking for an open line
/// of sight obviously avoids friendly fire, but also makes monsters spread out
/// and flank the hero, which plays and looks cool.
///
/// Once it's on a good targeting tile, it will keep walking towards adjacent
/// tiles that are farther from the hero but still in range until it's fully
/// charged.
///
/// If it decides to go melee, it simply pathfinds to the hero and goes for it.
/// In either case, the end result is walking one tile (or possibly standing
/// in place.)
